# IP City Standard DB Java SDK

This is a guide on how to use IP City DB Java SDK to get geolocation data for an IP address.

## Requirements

- JDK 21 (This SDK is built and tested using JDK 21).
- Only for MMDB database, at least 2-4 GB RAM only.

## Installation

Java SDK can be installed by different methods given below:

### Maven

Add the following dependency in `pom.xml` file to use the IP City DB Java SDK.

```maven
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.ipgeolocation</groupId>
    <artifactId>ip-city-std-db</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```gradle
implementation 'io.ipgeolocation:ip-city-std-db:1.0.0'
```

### Ivy

Add the following dependency code in `ivy.xml` file to use the IP City DB Java SDK.

```ivy
<dependency org="io.ipgeolocation" name="ip-city-std-db" rev="1.0.0"/>
```

## Basic Usage

### For Linux

Follow the steps below to consume the **IP City database**:

- Create `~/conf/ipgeolocation` directory in the `home` directory.
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/conf/ipgeolocation
  ```

- Create `database-config.json` file in the `~/conf/ipgeolocation` directory.
  ```bash
  vi ~/conf/ipgeolocation/database-config.json
  ```

* Write the following JSON config values in it (You can use any editor of your choice like `nano` or `vim`.):
  ```json 
  {"workingDirectory": "/etc/ipgeolocation","apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
  ```
* Against `workingDirectory` key, replace `/etc/ipgeolocation` value with the directory path where you want to place the
  database files.
* Against `apiKey` key, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` value with the API key from your database subscription.

### For Windows

Follow the steps below to consume the **IP City database**:

- Create `C:\conf\ipgeolocation` folders in the `C` or any other drive of your choice.

    ```bash
    C:
    mkdir conf\ipgeolocation
    ```

- Create `database-config.json` file in the `C:\conf\ipgeolocation` directory.
  ```bash
  cd conf\ipgeolocation
  copy nul database-config.json
  ```

* Write the following JSON config values in it (You can use any editor of your choice like `nano` or `vim`.):
  ```json 
  {"workingDirectory": "C:\\conf\\ipgeolocation","apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
  ```
* Against `workingDirectory` key, replace `C:\\conf\\ipgeolocation` value with the path of the directory where you want
  to place the database files.
* Against `apiKey` key, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` value with the API key from your database subscription.

### Response in Multiple Languages

The geolocation information for an IP address can be retrieved in the following languages:

- English (en)
- German (de)
- Russian (ru)
- Japanese (ja)
- French (fr)
- Chinese Simplified (cn)
- Spanish (es)
- Czech (cs)
- Italian (it)
- persian (fa)
- korean (ko)
- Portuguese (pt)

### Download Database Files

You can either:

- **Manually Download and Extract Files**:
  Download, extract, and place the database files in the working directory specified in your JSON configuration file.

- **Automatically Download Files Using SDK**:
  Use the SDK to download the database files automatically. The SDK will use the JSON config file to decide where to place DB files. Here's the code to download the database:

  ```java
  DatabaseUpdateService databaseUpdateService = DatabaseUpdateService.getInstance();
  databaseUpdateService.downloadDatabaseFromDatabaseDownloadAPI();
  ```

## How to Get IP Geolocation

### A. Single IP Geolocation Lookup

To get IP Geolocation, follow these steps:

#### 1. Configure Geolocation Parameters

Build the geolocation parameters with the necessary options, such as IP address and language:

 ```java
  IPGeolocationParams geolocationParams =
        IPGeolocationParams
                .builder()
                .withIPAddress("1.0.0.0") // Replace with your desired IPV4 or IPV6 address
                .withLang("en") // Optional: Specify language (en, de, ru, ja, fr, cn, es, cs, it, fa, ko, pt) (en is default)
                .build();
```

#### 2. Perform the Lookup

* Initialize the IP Geolocation Lookup Service and call the required method to get the geolocation data.

``` java
IPGeolocationLookupService ipGeolocationLookupService = IPGeolocationLookupService.getInstance();
IPGeolocation geolocation = ipGeolocationLookupService.getIPCityGeolocation(geolocationParams);
System.out.println(geolocation);
```

* By providing the IP address, you get the following output:

```
IPGeolocation{connectionType='Broadband', location=Location{city=City{name='Maidenhead'}, coordinates=Coordinates{latitude='51.52256', longitude='-0.72431'}, country=Country{capital='London', code2='GB', code3='GBR', codeIoc='GBR', continent=Continent{code='EU', name='Europe'}, currency=Currency{code='GBP', name='Pound Sterling', symbol='Â£'}, metadata=CountryMetadata{callingCode='+44', languages='en-GB,cy-GB,gd', tld='.uk'}, name='United Kingdom', nameOfficial='United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'}, district=District{name='Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead'}, geonameId='2643186', state=State{code='GB-ENG', name='England'}, zipcode='SL6'}, timeZone='Europe/London'}
```

* You can get the desired fields from the geolocation object by calling the respective getter methods.

```java
System.out.println(geolocation.getLocation()); // location Object has further details (city, country, state, district, zipcode, coordinates, geonameId)
System.out.println(geolocation.getConnectionType());
System.out.println(geolocation.getTimeZone());
```

### 3. Exceptions

The SDK throws the following exceptions:

**1. IllegalArgumentException**:

- Thrown when one or more arguments provided in json configuration file or to a method are invalid. This could occur if
  required parameters are missing or improperly formatted.

**2. IllegalStateException**:
- Thrown when JSON configuration file is not found in the specified directory.

**3. InvalidIPAddressException**:

- Thrown when the provided IP address is invalid, such as when the IP address format does not follow standard IPv4 or
  IPv6 notation.

**4. IPNotFoundException**:

- Thrown when the IP address cannot be found in the database. This could happen if the IP address is not included in the
  loaded geolocation data.

**5. BogonIPException**:

- Thrown when the provided IP address is a bogon IP, which refers to IP addresses that are reserved or not routable on
  the public internet. These addresses cannot be geolocated.

### B. Bulk IP Geolocation Lookup

To get Bulk IP Geolocation, follow these steps:

#### 1. Configure Bulk Geolocation Parameters

Build the bulk geolocation parameters with the necessary options, such as IP addresses and language:

```java
String[] ips = new String[]{"1.0.0.0", "1.0.0.1", "1.0.0.2"};
BulkGeolocationParams bulkGeolocationParams = BulkGeolocationParams.builder()
        .withIPAddresses(ips) // Replace with your desired IPV4, IPV6 addresses or both
        .withLang("en")  // Optional: Specify language (en, de, ru, ja, fr, cn, es, cs, it, fa, ko, pt) (en is default)
        .build();
```

#### 2. Perform the Lookup

* Initialize the IP Geolocation Lookup Service and call the required method to get the geolocation data.

``` java
IPGeolocationLookupService ipGeolocationLookupService = IPGeolocationLookupService.getInstance();
List<IPGeolocation> geolocationList = ipGeolocationLookupService.getIPCityGeolocation(bulkGeolocationParams);
System.out.println(geolocationList);
```

* You can get the desired fields from the geolocation object by calling the respective getter methods.

```java
IPGeolocation ipGeolocation = geolocationList.getFirst();
System.out.println(ipGeolocation.getLocation()); // location Object has further details (city, country, state, district, zipcode, coordinates, geonameId)
System.out.println(ipGeolocation.getConnectionType());
System.out.println(ipGeolocation.getTimeZone());
```

### 3. Exceptions

The SDK throws the following exceptions:

**1. IllegalArgumentException**:

- Thrown when one or more arguments provided in json configuration file or to a method are invalid. This could occur if
  required parameters are missing or improperly formatted.
- Thrown if provided ip array is empty or it's length is greater than 1000.

**2. IllegalStateException**:
- Thrown when JSON configuration file is not found in the specified directory.

**3. InvalidIPAddressException, IPNotFoundException, BogonIPException**:

- These exceptions are not thrown in bulk geolocation lookup. If an IP address is invalid, not found, or a bogon IP, the
  corresponding geolocation object will not be included in the list.
  Suppose that you query for 3 IP addresses and only 2 are valid, then the list will contain only 2 geolocation objects.
